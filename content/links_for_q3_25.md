Malina, [Energetic Aliens](https://stephenmalina.com/post/2021-07-01-energetic-aliens-among-us/). Alongside intelligence, mental stamina is perhaps the most important trait for producing great work. We know far too little  about the factors that help people consistently work long hours without burning out or losing creativity and to explore this, I've wanted to do a self-experiment where I try to raise my energy levels for a while, but haven't gotten around to this yet. Malina takes a different approach, collecting a bunch of stories of 'energetic aliens'—historical figures who have stood out with their productivity and stamina. Below, I'll quote some common themes between the case studies.

Passion for or obsession with the field:

> Grothendieck was also an energetic alien. According to multiple sources, he went through a ten-year period during which he invented (I suspect he would say discovered) algebraic geometry while spending 10-12 hours a day doing math at a blackboard. [...] To some, Grothendieck’s workload may seem light in comparison to Church’s and Hood’s 80-100 hour works. However, anyone who’s taken a pure math class knows that thinking about these ideas is difficult in a way that’s incomparable to most other cognitive activities.

> Erdos devoted his life to math, allegedly working 19 hour days for decades. In Daily Rituals, Mason Currey quotes one colleague’s summary of Erdos: "… he only needed three hours of sleep. He’d get up early and write letters, mathematical letters. He’d sleep downstairs. The first time he stayed, the clock was set wrong. It said 7:00, but it was really 4:30 A.M. He thought we should be up working, so he turned on the TV full blast. Later, when he knew me better, he’d come up at some early hour and tap on the bedroom door. “Ralph, do you exist?” The pace was grueling. He’d want to work from 8:00 A.M. until 1:30 A.M. Sure we’d break for short meals but we’d write on napkins and talk math the whole time. He’d stay a week or two and you’d collapse at the end."

Skin in the game:

> Knuth seems to have been able to do very difficult cognitive work for many hours while chronically sleep deprived. In fact, he himself says he did some of his best work in this state ([source](https://amturing.acm.org/pdf/KnuthTuringTranscript.pdf)): "I’ve always felt after that, hearing many other stories of people of when did they get these special insights that turned out to be important in their research thing, that was very rarely in a settled time of their life, where they had a comfortable living conditions and good – the word is escaping me now - but anyway, luxury; set up a nice office space and good lighting and so forth. No, people are working in a garret, they’re starving, they’ve got kids screaming, there’s a war going on or something. But that’s when they get a lot of their most… almost every breakthrough idea. I’ve always wondered, if you wanted to set up a think tank where you were going to get the most productivity out of your scientists, wouldn’t you have to, not exactly torture them, but deprive them of things? It’s not sustainable. Still, looking back, that was a time when I did as much science as I could, as well as try to fulfill all my other obligations."

> Unlike many of the other examples, Balzac’s motivation was at least partially extrinsic. An extravagant spender, Balzac spent his life constantly in debt, going to such lengths as using fake names in order to enable his exorbitant expenditures. Balzac seemingly partly maintained his insane schedule in order to make enough money to try and (unsuccessfully) dig himself out of these debts, stating “I’ll have to lead this life for some months, not to let myself be snowed under by my debts.”

A desire to prove something:

> In “In Memory Yet Green,” the first volume of [Isaac Asimov's] autobiography, published in 1979, he explained how he became a compulsive writer. His Russian-born father owned a succession of candy stores in Brooklyn that were open from 6 A.M. to 1 A.M. seven days a week. Young Isaac got up at 6 o’clock every morning to deliver papers and rushed home from school to help out in the store every afternoon. If he was even a few minutes late, his father yelled at him for being a folyack, Yiddish for sluggard. Even more than 50 years later, he wrote: “It is a point of pride with me that though I have an alarm clock, I never set it, but get up at 6 A.M. anyway. I am still showing my father I’m not a folyack.”

Stimulants:

> In addition to large amounts of coffee, Erdos famously used amphetamines – Benzedrine and Ritalin – (and anti-depressants) throughout his life. These amphetamines seemed to have played a key role in his productivity. Upon succeeding at a challenge to avoid amphetamines for a month, Erdos told the friend who’d issued the challenge (from Daily Rituals): "You’ve shown me I’m not an addict. But I didn’t get any work done. I’d get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I’d have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You’ve set mathematics back a month."

> Balzac was a card-carrying member of the better living through chemistry club. According to multiple sources, Balzac consumed around 50 cups of coffee a day, likely contributing to his untimely demise at age 51. Balzac’s relationship with coffee was so deep that he wrote a wonderful essay called [The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee](https://hex.ooo/library/pleasures_pains_coffee.html), in which he waxes poetically on the best ways of preparing coffee and its varied effects on the mind.

Karlsson, [Don't sacrifice the wrong thing](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/sacrifice). The essay is perfectly summarized by the following excerpt:

> Two years after I began emailing essays into the void, I was contacted by the founder of a startup. He wanted me to write for them. He offered me \$100k per year, which is about 5 times more than what I earn at the art gallery where I work part-time to pay the bills. I said thank you, but I wasn’t interested. He took that as a negotiating tactic. I played along. After five minutes, he offered me \$200k per year. “Well, that is interesting,” I said, getting carried away. “I’ll have to discuss it with my wife.” [...] I walked out to Johanna. She was in the vegetable garden, picking aphids off the artichokes. The children were playing with the soil between the planting beds. Halfway through telling her how much money I could make, Johanna broke me off, saying, “But why on earth would you accept that?” She was genuinely confused. She brushed some grass from her shirt, and said, “You wouldn’t have time to write.” And by God—who cares that we can’t afford a car when I get to live with a person who says things like that? Of course, I don’t want \$200k to write things I doubt the value of. What is the opportunity cost? If I do this, if I go on this vacation, if I get this car, what am I turning down? By asking yourself this, and then consistently aiming to pick the thing that optimizes for what you most deeply value—it adds up. It makes life rich.

While I wholeheartedly agree with the general sentiment, I'm not sure whether I agree that the offer wasn't worth taking even for a single year—after all, a year on a \$200k salary buys you 10 years of uninterrupted writing. But maybe it's better to do what you love with your skin in the game, as suggested by the quotes from Energetic Aliens above.

Karlsson, [On Agency](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/agency). Henrik argues that agency is the combination of two skills: the capacity to formulate autonomous goals in life and the ability and willingness to pursue those goals. Though agency is often framed as a hard-edged, aggressive approach, Henrik views agency as something gentle, "an attunement to the world and the self". ...
